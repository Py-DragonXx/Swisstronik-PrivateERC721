# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample hardhat contract which deploys a private NFT on the swisstronik testnet 2.0.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network swisstronik
npx hardhat run scripts/mint.js --network swisstronik

```
